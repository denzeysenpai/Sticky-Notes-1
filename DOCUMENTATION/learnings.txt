In this project I have learned:

1. confirm()
2. code was too simple so maybe I need to upgrade it in the future.
3. the 'order: order-pos;' in CSS, dictates the order of the element 
    its container.
4. grid-templates like 'grid-template-columns: repeat(autofill, pixels)'.
5. The appendChild() method of the Node interface adds 
    a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node.



Things I need to improve on:

1. Definitely javaScript code quality and knowledge(?).
2. CSS design, mainly Grids, Flexbox, Typography and color choices.
